# feminizer
An embarassingly simple Chrome plugin that "feminizes" a web page, turning all male pronouns to female ones

I was tired of reading about baby boys when I was trying to learn about my baby girl's development on Baby Center 
so I made this plugin so I don't have to translate pronouns in my head while I'm reading the articles.
